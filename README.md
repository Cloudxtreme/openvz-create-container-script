OpenVZ Script to automate the creation of container through the command line
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script has only one purpose, it is to help me create my OpenVZ containers. 
Since I use OpenVZ to create development servers I use a predefined amount of RAM
for my servers. The script could be modified in such a way that we could specified
this amount of RAM throguh the command line. I will probably end up doing it later.
